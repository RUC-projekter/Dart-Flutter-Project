# Dart-Flutter-Project
In this project the group has developed an app for the now existing travel card called “rejsekort”. Instead of having a card to hold on to, and walk around with, you can use an app on the phone. In that way, the user does not have to worry about losing their card for example. The group chose to use Dart as a programming language, and Flutter, both created by google, to help build it.

# Technologies Used
Dart: The primary programming language used for app development.
Flutter: Our choice of the Flutter framework, known for its cross-platform capabilities and expressive UI.

# App Features
